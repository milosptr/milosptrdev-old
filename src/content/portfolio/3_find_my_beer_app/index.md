I wanted to explore NativeScript, so I made little brand and start working on the app. The user can login or proceed as a guest. User will be redirected to home, where he can see listed bears fetched from Punk API. At the top there are bears with highest ABV and under are listed all bears. 

It has search page, where user can search for his fav beer. After choosing the beer, the user sees a single beer page, with beer info and like button.  

User can save beer in his profile by liking the chosen beer. It will be saved in App Storage and user can see all liked beers in the profile page subpage "Liked beers".
