Najletovi is Serbian flight booking engine. I've used Angular for front end and PHP for back end. 

This web app uses Kiwi REST API for fetching flights and offers. Booking engine has few date options that you can search for (anytime, exact date, dates interval, days staying). I've added an option for tracking prices and there are 3 cron jobs a day that are checking price change. If there is change, you'll got email offer for your saved trip.
 
 It also has a payment system implemented via Zooz API. So customers can pay online by any credit card.
