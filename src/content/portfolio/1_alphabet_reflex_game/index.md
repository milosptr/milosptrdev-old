When user starts a game it should set off the counter that will randomly switch numbers between 1-26. 

Before starting user will have an option to switch between difficulties. User needs to input the letter that is mapped to the according number. If inputed letter matches the number that its mapped to, letter will change color to green. If inputed letter does not match or nothing is inputed, corresponding letter will turn red.  

Goal of the game is to match all the letters with corresponding numbers. Score in the top right corner should be updated automatically.
