Octra is an online booking engine where you can easily book train, bus or flight ticket. It supports user login and registration. 

The idea is to save all user travels and data so he/she can easily see their booking summary or book next trip with just one click. 

Project is still on the go. The backend is managed by _Laravel_ and the _ReactJS_ is running on the front end.
