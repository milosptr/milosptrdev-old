I’m <span>Milos</span> , a 22 years old self-taught <span>Full Stack</span> developer , from <span>Serbia</span> .

After my high school, I got a job as a web developer, where I stayed 1 year. For whole year I created over 100 simple HTML & CSS websites following given designs, developed up to 15 WordPress websites (few with custom theme and others were purchased). After 1 year I realized that I’m _stuck_ and _sinking_, that I am _not learning anything_.

In March 2018, my ex-colleague found me a new job at his firm where I can start going forward and learn some new technologies. I stayed here 1 year and start exploring <span>JavaScript</span> and <span>PHP</span> world. I have learned many things building a mobile web app in PHP and a website with custom backend. Long story short, after that, there were no new projects and I was stuck again.

I decided it was _time for change_, so I started studying <span>ReactJS</span> in my free time. I fell _in love with JavaScript and React_. Colleague and I got an idea to build a _flight booking engine_, so I started progressively learning <span>Angular</span> and built the whole <em>booking system with online payment</em> in Angular 1. As _I got better in JavaScript_ I figure that Angular 1 was a _bad idea_, so I switched again back to ReactJS and start rebuilding the whole system.

I got a _job offer_ where I could finally start _working on myself_ and I took a chance in April 2019. Currently I am working here and I can’t express <em>how much I learned so far</em>. During this little time, I changed my mindset to become a _Full Stack Developer_. I started actively working in <span>Laravel</span>, <span>VueJS</span> and <span>NativeScript</span> ( app development ).

In this new company and great colleague support I became _very committed_, _hard working_, _curious_ and _fast learning_ developer.
